I want to become frontend developer. I like to create something new and constantly becoming better at coding. Because it`s interesting and helps peoples with their problems.
I know html, css, git, javascript.
I finished KPI in the field of electronics. My first experience with programming was solving labs in university. Also, online courses like freecodecamp.
I have B1 level of English.
